Just a chatterbot test and sandbox. 
Any discoveries are to be noted here. 

This software, requires a library called Chatterbot, which is basically going to provide me with the tools I need to build the bot. 

So far, I have discovered that I can modify the chatbot's base knowledge to a degree that is quite fundamental, which I found fascinating, tho I mustn't dwelve. 

This was learned while using the corpus_trainer and the list_trainer methods simultaneously.

Now, the following will narrate the story of how trying with only one of the lists at a time goes as per the chatbot's behaviour. This will require a full on deletion of the database as it is created automatically by the bot instance.
